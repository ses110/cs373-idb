It was first created February 2015 and I have been slowly modifying the layout, fixing mobile issues, adding new pages, and trying to create a real theme for myself.\r\nIt was a project done in C++ to implement our own Integer class.\r\n\r\n## When was it?\r\n\r\nFirst created in February 2015 and has had a continuous string of change every week since.\r\n\r\n## Where was this?\r\n\r\nThis was done from home during my leisure.\r\n\r\n## Why was it done?\r\n\r\nI have always wanted my own personal website where I could project my thoughts, my style (music and ideas), for anyone who was interestd and show my love for photography.\r\n\r\n## How was it done?\r\n\r\nBy using Wix's HTML editor, I slowly created my own website. I am still learning about adding my own HTML code and changes in CSS style files as I go.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
