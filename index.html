<h2>
<a id="who-was-it-for" class="anchor" href="#who-was-it-for" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who was it for?</h2>

<p>This website was created for myself and for anyone willing to follow along.</p>

<h2>
<a id="what-was-it" class="anchor" href="#what-was-it" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What was it?</h2>

<p>This project is my own personal website that I have been slowly working on. It was first created February 2015 and I have been slowly modifying the layout, fixing mobile issues, adding new pages, and trying to create a real theme for myself.

<h2>
<a id="when-was-it" class="anchor" href="#when-was-it" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>When was it?</h2>

<p>First created in February 2015 and has had a continuous string of change every week since.</p>

<h2>
<a id="where-was-this" class="anchor" href="#where-was-this" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Where was this?</h2>

<p>This was done from home during my leisure.</p>

<h2>
<a id="why-was-it-done" class="anchor" href="#why-was-it-done" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why was it done?</h2>

<p>I have always wanted my own personal website where I could project my thoughts, my style (music and ideas), for anyone who was interestd and show my love for photography.</p>

<h2>
<a id="how-was-it-done" class="anchor" href="#how-was-it-done" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How was it done?</h2>

<p>By using Wix's HTML editor, I slowly created my own website. I am still learning about adding my own HTML code and changes in CSS style files as I go.</p>
